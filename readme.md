## What is Puppet Ack?

[ack](http://betterthangrep.com/) is a better grep. It also has different package names on debian and redhat flavoured systems, and this module takes care of that so you'll always end up with an `ack` command.

## How do I use it?

```
include ack
```

## This is terrible! Or even, how can I help?

Pull requests, issues or advice are very (very!) welcome.

## To do

* Write tests and test across platforms.
